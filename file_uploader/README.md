### For improvements
1. Migrate from Aiven to Supabase
2. Add a share folder functionality. When a user wants to share a folder (and all of its contents), they should have a form to specify the duration i.e. 1d, 10d etc. This should generate a link that can be shared with anyone (unauthenticated users). For example, the link could be in the following format: https://yourapp.com/share/c758c495-0705-44c6-8bab-6635fd12cf81
